# Engineering Language Policy

## Status

This document is a mandatory engineering policy for SideBySide Next.

> **Engineering language = English. Product language = i18n.**

English is the single language for implementation, maintenance, review, and technical collaboration in this repository. User-facing product content remains localized through the i18n architecture.

## Mandatory English engineering surfaces

Use English for:

- source identifiers: variables, functions, methods, classes, interfaces, types, enums, constants, and internal module names;
- source comments, docstrings, KDoc/JSDoc, and technical annotations;
- tests, test names, fixtures that are not intentionally locale-specific, and assertion messages;
- logs, internal exception messages, CLI output, build output, and developer-facing diagnostics;
- shell scripts, CI/CD workflows, Docker/deployment scripts, and developer tooling;
- API/OpenAPI descriptions, DTO/schema descriptions, database identifiers, migrations, environment variables, and configuration keys;
- active technical documentation, ADRs, contributor instructions, implementation plans, and engineering checklists;
- issue titles and descriptions, pull-request titles and descriptions, review comments, and commit messages.

## Product and localization boundary

The engineering-language rule must not turn the product into an English-only application.

User-visible text belongs in localization resources whenever the client architecture supports localization. In particular:

- German product text belongs in German i18n resources;
- English product text belongs in English i18n resources;
- additional locales remain supported by the same mechanism;
- locale-specific test fixtures may contain the locale they intentionally verify;
- protocol literals, externally mandated strings, trademarks, quoted source material, and compatibility values may retain their required spelling.

Backend/API behavior should prefer stable language-neutral error codes for errors that may reach a client. Clients translate those codes into localized product messages. Internal diagnostics remain English.

## Exceptions

Exceptions must be narrow and explicit. The following are allowed:

1. **Localization resources and locale-specific fixtures** — non-English content is expected by design.
2. **Externally mandated literals** — protocol, standard, provider, compatibility, trademark, or quoted values that must keep their original spelling.
3. **Frozen historical snapshots** — dated review/audit snapshots that repository governance explicitly treats as immutable may remain in their original language. New historical snapshots created after this policy takes effect must be written in English.
4. **Generated/vendor content** — do not edit generated or vendored output manually. Change the source schema/generator/configuration instead; generated content should become English when its authoritative source is migrated.

An exception is not permission to add new German engineering prose to active source code or active technical documentation.

## Migration rule

Existing non-English engineering content is technical debt tracked by issue #212 and its follow-up work. New or materially edited engineering content must follow this policy immediately, even while untouched legacy content is still being migrated.

When modifying a legacy file for functional work, translate nearby engineering comments/messages when doing so is low risk and does not obscure the functional diff. Large unrelated translations should remain in the dedicated migration work.

## Review rule

A pull request is not merge-ready when it introduces new non-English engineering content without a valid exception. Reviewers and coding agents must treat this rule like the repository's other governance constraints.
