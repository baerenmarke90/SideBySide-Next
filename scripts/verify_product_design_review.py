"""Verify the mandatory Product Design / UX declarations on a pull request body.

Enforces Issue #824: a smartphone-first partner-app invariant declaration is
mandatory for every PR that changes user-facing client paths (as classified by
``scripts/classify_product_design_paths.py``). This module owns the machine-
checkable part of that gate only: are the required declarations present and
checked. It cannot and does not judge whether the resulting UI is actually
warm, beautiful, or genuinely smartphone-first — that remains human/product
visual acceptance (`docs/PARTNER-APP-EXPERIENCE-STANDARD.md` section 12/13).
