"""The Relations slice must mirror the contract decided in M3-D08/D09.

Two guarantees exist exclusively in the shape of the relation contract.

For relation operations, the target type is encoded in the path, not the body
or a selector parameter. No typed relation operation accepts a `targetType`,
and no relation-target list schema contains such a discriminator. That is what
separates Option A in `docs/m3/API-DESIGN.md` from the
`(targetType,targetId)` polymorphism excluded by M3-D08.

A derived read model may still identify the type of an item it returns. In
particular, the Chapter content projection needs `targetType` to distinguish
Memory, HeartMoment, and Milestone entries without turning relation writes into
a polymorphic API.

None of the relation write operations has a request body. A relation consists
exclusively of the two IDs in the path; a body would create room for a field
that names one of the sides differently again.
