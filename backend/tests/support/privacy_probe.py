"""A minimal resource on which authorization can be exercised.

Deliberately not a product domain. The authorization foundation must apply to
arbitrary future domains, and a test tied to HeartMoments would bind it to that
domain while also creating M2 code before it is approved.

The probe therefore carries exactly what authorization needs: the three
columns from `PrivateResourceMixin` and a text field that makes a leak visible.

The table is attached to `Base.metadata` because its foreign keys point to
`spaces` and `accounts`. It is created exclusively through `create_all` in the
test fixture: `alembic/env.py` imports only production models, so the probe
appears in no migration and no production database.
