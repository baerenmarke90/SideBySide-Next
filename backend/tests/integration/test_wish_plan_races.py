"""Exercise PostgreSQL races and rollbacks in the Wish-to-Plan lifecycle.

The guarantee from M3-D02 is strict: no race may leave a `PLANNED` Wish
without its originating Plan or create a second originating Plan. These tests
reproduce that behavior with concurrent transactions against the same database
rather than with mocks.

Each test verifies both that the calls return an allowed result and that the
final state is one of the permitted outcomes. Checking only the responses could
otherwise let a partial lifecycle pass as long as the diagnostics looked
plausible.
