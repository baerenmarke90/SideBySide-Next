"""Concurrency around typed content relations.

M3-D26 defines the lock order: parent first, target second. Every test here
verifies both that two concurrent requests reach a domain outcome instead of a
deadlock or 500, and that the final state violates none of the guarantees from
M3-D09.

The most important case is the last one: Relation creation against a
HeartMoment privacy transition. Exactly two final states are allowed: shared
with a relation, or private without a relation. The third state, private with a
relation, would prove the existence of private content to the partner and must
not occur under any transaction interleaving.
