"""Concurrency around Place deletion and Plan assignment.

The canonical lock order in the M3 core is `Place -> Wish -> Plan`. The Plan is
always locked last. If an operation locked the Place after the Plan, two
requests could block each other and PostgreSQL would abort one with a deadlock,
turning a normal domain operation into a 500.

The suite therefore verifies both that concurrent calls reach an allowed
outcome and that the final state never contains a Plan pointing at a deleted
Place.
