"""Concurrency coverage for the canonical-demo dataset mutation boundary (#690).

Before this boundary existed, the only cross-process lock in the demo reset
path guarded scheduler bookkeeping (`demo.reset._lock`, whether a pending
reset Job already exists), not the dataset mutation itself: a manual CLI
`create`/`ensure`/`reset` could still race a scheduled worker reset, or two
manual invocations could race each other, against the same reserved Lea/Alex
Space. A sequential test cannot exercise that race; it needs two genuinely
concurrent transactions.
