"""Turn a privacy class into a query predicate.

The important property is that this module produces SQL expressions rather
than booleans for already-loaded rows. A rule evaluated only after loading is
too late: the row has already entered memory, response sizing, and potentially
logs. Privacy belongs in the query itself.

New behavior is added to the rule table rather than at call sites. A new class
gets one function and one registration; existing domains then inherit the new
rule without route-specific changes.
