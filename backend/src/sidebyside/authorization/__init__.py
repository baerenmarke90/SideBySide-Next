"""Owner and privacy authorization.

The second half of the access question. The tenant guard in
`sidebyside.relationship.service` establishes whether an account belongs to a
Space; only then does this module decide what the account may see and change
inside that Space.

A domain needs three things:

    class PrivateNote(IdMixin, TimestampMixin, PrivateResourceMixin, Base):
        __tablename__ = "private_notes"
        privacy_absence: ClassVar[ResourceAbsence] = ResourceAbsence(
            "Note not found.", "PRIVATE_NOTE_NOT_FOUND"
        )

    note = require_readable(session, PrivateNote, context, note_id)
    notes = session.execute(readable(PrivateNote, context)).scalars().all()

Nothing more. There is no place where a domain defines its own visibility
condition.
