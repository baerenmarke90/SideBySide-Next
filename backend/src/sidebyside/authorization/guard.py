"""Query boundary for private resources.

Everything a domain needs to enforce privacy lives here, and only here. A
domain describes its data with ``PrivateResourceMixin`` and calls these
functions; it does not restate visibility predicates. A second handwritten
guard would be a second place for authorization to drift.

The authorization condition is always part of the query. This module
intentionally has no function that validates an already-loaded row: by then the
row would already have been read before permission was checked.
