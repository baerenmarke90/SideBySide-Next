"""Password derivation.

Argon2id is the current recommended standard. Unlike tokens, passwords should
use an intentionally slow scheme: they have low entropy and would otherwise be
cheap to test against a dictionary.

This is the only place in the project that needs a cryptography library. Token
handling uses the standard library.
