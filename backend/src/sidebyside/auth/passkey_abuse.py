"""Abuse boundary for anonymous passkey authentication starts.

Starting WebAuthn authentication deliberately knows neither account nor
credential. The only available rate-limit key is therefore the client's
network identity after it has been resolved at the trusted HTTP boundary.

In production, ``request.client.host`` comes from the ASGI scope normalized by
Uvicorn. Forwarded headers are evaluated there only for explicitly configured
``FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS``. This module deliberately parses neither ``Forwarded``
nor ``X-Forwarded-For`` itself.
