"""The durable technical identity of the two canonical demo personas.

`display_name` is presentation state in the domain model (see
`sidebyside.demo.canonical` and `docs/DEMO-SPACE.md`) and must never again be
the thing create/ensure/reset use to recognize a canonical demo Account
(#633). Public Demo visitors are already prevented from changing it at all
through the normal profile API (#697), but legacy data from before this
marker existed, an operator edit, or a direct database change can still leave
it drifted, and the demo maintenance path must remain recoverable when it
does.

This table is the stable alternative: a private demo-only registry stating
which already-verified reserved-address Account currently plays each
persona. It is keyed by the persona, not by the Account, so at most one
Account can ever hold a given persona, and `account_id` is independently
unique so the reverse also holds. Deliberately its own table rather than a
column on `accounts` so the core identity model stays free of a demo-only
concept, and so the whole invariant can be dropped by a single migration
without touching `accounts`.
