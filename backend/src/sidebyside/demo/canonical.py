"""The reserved identities the public demo must be able to recognize again.

The demo is a shared, publicly reachable deployment whose content is thrown
away and rebuilt on a timer. That only works while the two reserved Accounts
stay recognizable: create/ensure/reset resolve them by their reserved address
and a durable technical identity marker (`sidebyside.demo.models`), never by
`display_name`, because a demo it cannot identify is one it must not delete a
Space for. `display_name` is presentation state in the domain model and must
never serve as durable technical demo identity: legacy data from before this
marker existed, an operator edit, or a direct database change can still leave
it drifted, and create/ensure/reset/demo-entry must remain recoverable when it
does (#633).

Public Demo visitors are currently prevented from changing an Account-global
reserved-persona name at all through the normal profile API (#697):
`DEMO_CANONICAL_IDENTITY_IMMUTABLE`, enforced by `ensure_account_identity_mutable`
below, keeps an ordinary visitor from causing that drift in the first place.
This is not what create/ensure/reset depend on, though -- they recognize and
recover from a drifted name on their own (#633) -- it exists so a persona is
never visibly mislabeled to other visitors in the meantime. It is enforced
here rather than by hiding a control in a client: a visitor holds an ordinary
bearer token and can call the API directly; UI visibility is a representation
of a server decision, never the decision itself.

This module deliberately depends only on configuration, the identity models,
and the lightweight demo identity-marker model. The services that must not
corrupt a reserved identity, and the public demo-entry endpoint, can therefore
import it without importing the demo seeding service that imports them.
