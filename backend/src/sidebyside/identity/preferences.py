"""Account timezone and locale write boundary.

Both values control visible behavior: `timezone` determines which calendar
day currently applies to a person, while `locale` controls language and
formats. As free text they would be a silent source of errors because a typo
might surface only when an anniversary appears on the wrong day.

This module therefore defines exactly one write path for these fields. Every
future write path - account settings, imports, or legacy-data migration - goes
through `set_preferences`. The alternative would be to duplicate validation
at every new endpoint; the rationale for avoiding that is captured in
`authorization.guard`.

Reads remain unaffected: `clock.resolve_zone` still falls back to UTC, with
logging, for already persisted unusable values. Legacy data must not break a
view.
