"""Binding-aware media cleanup for accepted Account deletions.

Attachment rows are technically OWNER_ONLY even when their binding points at a
retained SPACE_SHARED parent. Account deletion therefore cannot bulk-delete
media by ``owner_id`` alone. This module treats ownership only as the candidate
set, resolves every current binding through the shared retention classifier,
and delegates physical deletion to the existing retry-safe attachment lifecycle.
