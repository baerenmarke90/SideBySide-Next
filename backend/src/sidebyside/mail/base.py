"""Boundary for outgoing mail.

The application core knows neither SMTP nor a provider. It knows a message and
a sender.

One rule applies to every implementation: **message content does not belong in
logs.** Authentication mail carries a valid one-time token. Logging that token
would create a second copy of the authentication proof in a system with very
different retention and access controls.
