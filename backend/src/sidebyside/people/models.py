"""Persistence for related people and important dates.

A child, parent, or friend: for SideBySide these are not accounts. They do
not sign in, have no session, and receive no invitation. They are records
maintained by a partner in their space and therefore contain data about
third parties who cannot manage those records themselves. For that reason,
less is stored here than would technically be possible: display name,
relationship type, and a birthday. No address, school, or phone number.

The display name and the label of an important date are the protected parts
and are stored as `ProtectedPayload`, separate from metadata. Everything
needed for sorting, linking, and later reminders - relationship, date,
recurrence, and visibility - remains queryable as columns.

    `related_person_id` is optional: the couple's own anniversary belongs to

    class, and both values together form a foreign key. This achieves two
    things at once that would otherwise require two service checks:

    - The space must match. An important date cannot point to a person from
      another space, even due to a bug in domain logic.
    - An important date is never more open than its person. A `SPACE_SHARED`
      date attached to an `OWNER_ONLY` person would reveal that the person
      exists, which is exactly what the private record must prevent.

    `ON UPDATE CASCADE` keeps the copy current, while `ON DELETE CASCADE`
    removes dates for a deleted person. `SET NULL` is not possible here:
    `space_id` is part of the same foreign key and may not become null.
