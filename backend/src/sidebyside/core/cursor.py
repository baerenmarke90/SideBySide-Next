"""Signed opaque keyset cursors.

A cursor identifies a position in a sorted, already-authorized set. It is not
secret, but it is not a client-controlled field either: if a client could
choose it freely, it could continue a query past a filter boundary. Each
cursor therefore carries an HMAC signature over its complete contents and the
context in which it was issued.

The binding is the important part. A cursor from another Space or from
different filters is not a valid continuation point even when its signature
is valid, because it describes a position in a different set. The context is
therefore included in the signed data and checked against the current request
when redeemed instead of merely being supplied alongside it.

Each domain defines its keyset position (`position`) and the context to which
the cursor is bound (`binding`); this module knows neither sort keys nor
filters. Memories, HeartMoments, and later Story can therefore share the same
signing and binding mechanism without each collection implementing its own
variant, which otherwise risks subtle divergence in one binding check.
