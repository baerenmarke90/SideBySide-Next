"""HTTP contract for typed M3 content relations.

M3-D08 selects option A from ``docs/m3/API-DESIGN.md``: nested routes per
target type rather than one generic relation endpoint with a discriminator.
The target type therefore lives in the path instead of the body. A client
cannot name a type the contract does not already know, and the OpenAPI types
remain free of unions.

Routes are created through ``_register`` because they differ only by target
type. The registered paths and ``operation_id`` values are nevertheless
fixed: the generated schema is identical to nine separately written
functions, without nine opportunities to make one subtly different.

``PUT`` is idempotent and always returns ``204``. Whether the relation was
just created or already existed is irrelevant to the caller, and returning
``201`` versus ``200`` would reveal what another device had just done.
