"""Operational health endpoints.

Two separate questions require two different answers:

- ``/health``: is the process running? This does not touch the database, so an
  orchestrator does not restart the container merely because the database is
  temporarily unavailable.
- ``/health/ready``: can the process serve requests? This checks the database.

Both responses expose the build revision in a response header so operators can
verify that a healthy deployment is also the intended deployment.
