"""Retention and cleanup for attachments.

Retention periods are defined by M2-D12 and M2-D20. This job does not decide
them; it makes those rules actually happen. A deadline that exists only in a
document is not an enforced deadline.

The job follows the same pattern as security maintenance: an ordinary task in
the existing queue that schedules its next run after completing. No second
scheduler and no container cron are introduced.
