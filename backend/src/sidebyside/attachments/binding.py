"""Binding between attachments and domain resources.

M2-D03 requires exclusive ownership: an attachment belongs to at most one
parent. That rule intentionally lives in exactly one place here rather than in
every domain that uses attachments.

There is no denormalized parent column on the attachment. Such a column would
be a second source of truth beside relations and could drift from them; the
question "is this bound?" is answered from the relations themselves.
