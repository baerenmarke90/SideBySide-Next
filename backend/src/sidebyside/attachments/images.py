"""Validate, sanitize, and resize images.

This is the first place untrusted bytes are interpreted. It runs exclusively in
a background job, never in the request path, and assumes every file may be
malicious.

Three rules apply:

- Nothing declared by the file is trusted. Format, dimensions, and type come
  from the decoder rather than request headers or client declarations.
- Only allowlisted information leaves this boundary. Metadata is discarded and
  explicitly reconstructed field by field rather than filtered in place.
- Data that cannot be processed safely fails; it is never stored on a
  best-effort basis.
