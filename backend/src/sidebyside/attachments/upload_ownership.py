"""Cross-process ownership for attachment upload versus retention cleanup.

The request unit of work deliberately spans a whole HTTP request. That makes an
ordinary ORM ``flush()`` unsuitable as upload authority: cleanup in another
process cannot see the change before request commit. Server-stream uploads use a
short committed claim before body transfer, then take the Attachment row lock
only for the bounded provider mutation and DB finalization.

This gives both sides one PostgreSQL authority without holding an Attachment row
lock while a client can stream arbitrarily slowly.
