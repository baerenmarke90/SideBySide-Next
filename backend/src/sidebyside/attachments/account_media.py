"""Account-owned storage home for Account-global profile media (#692).

The avatar is Account-global presentation identity: the same current image
renders in every Space where its Account is an active member, and self-exit
from one Space deliberately keeps it. Its backing ``Attachment`` was still
Space-owned, so the final zero-active-Space purge removed the row and cascaded
the profile binding away. An Account that stayed active elsewhere lost its
avatar because two lifecycles claimed the same object.

This module resolves that by making ownership follow the contract instead of
the upload location. Binding an attachment as Account profile media *adopts*
it: the provider object moves to the Account storage home and the row loses its
Space key, after which the Account is its only lifecycle parent. Space
retention then has nothing of that Account's profile media left to purge, and
no ``Attachment`` row survives pointing at a removed Space.

Adoption is not a visibility change. The avatar remains readable only through
the profile-avatar route, which authorizes the subject's profile in the
caller's own Space before it resolves any binding. Storage location never
grants access here.

Ordering is chosen so an interruption can never destroy the binding:

1. copy the object to the Account home, skipping variants already there;
2. move the row to the Account home and, in the same transaction, enqueue the
   removal of the Space-home object.

Until (2) commits, the Space-home object is still the authoritative one and the
avatar keeps rendering. After it commits, the origin removal is a durable Job
with the origin key in its payload, so a crash in between retries rather than
leaking. A copy made by a transaction that later rolled back is collected by
``service.purge``, which removes both possible homes of a row.
